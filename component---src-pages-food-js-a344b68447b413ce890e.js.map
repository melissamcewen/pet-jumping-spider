There are a variety of options that jumping spiders enjoy and are easy to keep. </p>\n\n   <p>Offer your spider food every 3 days. But don't expect them to eat every time. How often they eat depends on age, species, and sex. Young spiders eat more than older spiders. And female spiders usually eat more than males. Some older adults go as long as a month without eating. Spiders sitting on eggs or molting may also go weeks without eating.</p>\n\n    <p>As spiders get to be adults try feeding them every three days and then calibrate based on how often they accept prey. If they refuse, go up to four days, then five, and so on. Refusal can take the form of running away from prey or just ignoring it. If they suddenly become especially eager for the food or more active, feed them more often.</p>\n    <p>The best time to feed is morning. If they don't eat it, remove it at night. Most jumping spiders are diurnal (active during the day). Uneaten prey may disturb or harm them at night.</p>\n\n    <h2>Water</h2>\n    <p>Offer your spider droplets of water to drink and also keep their enclosure humid. This can be done at the same time as offering food. Many keepers use a spray bottle and just spray on the sides of the enclosure (not ON the spider). </p>\n    <p>Do you need special water? That's a tough question. Most keepers use tap water without issues, but if you suspect your tap water isn't the highest quality, you can buy distilled water.</p>\n\n    <Alert color=\"warning\">\n      Open containers of water and large droplets may drown spiderlings and very small adults.\n    </Alert>\n    <p></p>\n\n    <h2>Types of Food</h2>\n    <p>Here are some food options that are popular in the hobby:</p>\n\n     <Table responsive>\n        <thead>\n          <tr>\n            <th>Species</th>\n            <th>Ideal for</th>\n            <th>Pros</th>\n            <th>Cons</th>\n            <th>Where to purchase</th>\n          </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n          <tr>\n            <th scope=\"row\">Flies (green and bluebottle) </th>\n            <td>Adult spiders</td>\n            <td>Can keep for a long time in fridge, most species prefer them, some species like otiosus strongly prefer flies (and may refuse non-flying prey)</td>\n            <td>Having flies in your fridge (eeew)</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.mantisplace.com/\">Mantisplace</a></td>\n          </tr>\n          <tr>\n            <th scope=\"row\">Crickets</th>\n            <td>Adult spiders</td>\n            <td>Easy to purchase at the local pet store</td>\n            <td>Can be dangerous to molting, resting, or sick spiders.
